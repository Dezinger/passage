 * Place here the cnfiguration for API services, like:
 *
 * return [
 *     'service' => [
 *         'to' => '',
 *     ]
 * ];
 *
 * Wherein:
 * - "service" is the part of the URL that determines when the external URL will be called.
 * - "to" is the URL that will be called when the "service" is matched
 *
 * For example:
 * return [
 *     'github' => [
 *         'to' => 'https://api.github.com/users',
 *     ]
 * ];
 *
 * If your application received http://127.0.0.1:8000/github/morcen, this package will fetch
 * https://api.github.com/users/morcen and the response will be returned as your app's response.
